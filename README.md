SpreeNewsletter
===============

Introduction goes here.

Installation
------------

Add spree_newsletter to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'spree_newsletter', github: 'fruqi/spree_newsletter'
```

Bundle your dependencies and run the installation generator:

```shell
bundle
bundle exec rails g spree_newsletter:install
```

Adding Sidekiq
--------------

It's a good idea to add your action mailer to sidejob.
Therefore, you can add sidekiq into your spree application and override the admin/newsletters_controller.

Attention! If you have issue with sidekiq worker during the integration, there is a high possibility that your sidekiq version is below 3.x. Thus, upgrade your sidekiq and you should be good to go.


Testing
-------

First bundle your dependencies, then run `rake`. `rake` will default to building the dummy app if it does not exist, then it will run specs. The dummy app can be regenerated by using `rake test_app`.

```shell
bundle
bundle exec rake
```

When testing your applications integration with this extension you may use it's factories.
Simply add this require statement to your spec_helper:

```ruby
require 'spree_newsletter/factories'
```
